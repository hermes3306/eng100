71. Im' not much of a talker
A I think I have a crush on Kate
B Rumor has it she's taken. But why not give it a try
A I can't work up the courage. I'm not much of a talker.
B Don't be so hard on yourself. You're a nice guy.
A Just between you and me. I'll try to pick her up.
B That's the spirit! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
