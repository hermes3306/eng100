56 Make it on time
A Wake up, sleepyhead! You sleep in every day
B I tossed and turned all night. I couldn't sleep a wink
A I'm wondering if you can make it on time for school
B I'm in the middle of washing my hair already
A You're the black sheep of our family
B Come on. I just forgot to see the alarm.
